**Household Energy Access and Clean Cooking Transition Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of household energy consumption patterns across selected African nations, specifically Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, and South Africa. The dashboard is designed to visualize the financial burden of energy costs and the readiness of households to transition to cleaner cooking alternatives like LPG and Electricity.
Key Visualizations and Insights

**1. Market Segmentation**

The dashboard segments households based on several critical factors:

•	Geographic Distribution: Mapping respondents across East, West, and Southern Africa.

•	Demographics: Analysis of household size, showing a majority of one-member households at 79%, and gender distribution, such as 50% female representation in Kenya.

•	Current Energy Mix: Identifying the primary cooking fuels used, including Charcoal (43%), Firewood, LPG, and Electricity.

**2. Financial Burden Analysis**

•	Monthly Energy Cost: Comparative view of average costs across countries, such as 18,000 in Somalia compared to 1,000 in Kenya.

•	Energy Burden Perception: A donut chart showing that 21% of respondents view energy costs as a significant financial burden.

**3. Targeting for Transition**

The "Willingness to Switch" visualization is a key targeting tool for policy makers:

•	Somalia shows the highest willingness to switch at 50%.

•	Kenya follows with 38% willingness.

•	South Africa shows 13% readiness.

**Recommendations**

**1. Public Sector and Policy Makers**

**Targeted Subsidies:** Design subsidy programs for the 21% of households facing a high financial burden to transition them from Charcoal and Firewood to cleaner alternatives.

**Infrastructure Prioritization:** 
Focus clean energy infrastructure and grid stability efforts in Somalia and Kenya, where the **"Willingness to Switch"** is highest (50% and 38% respectively).

**Health and Climate Policy:** 
Prioritize the 43% Charcoal-using segment for respiratory health interventions and carbon reduction initiatives.

**2. Private Sector and Clean Energy Providers**

**Product Sizing:** 
Develop and market smaller, more affordable energy units (such as single-burner LPG stoves or mini electric pressure cookers) to meet the needs of the 79% single-member household majority.

**Flexible Payment Models:**
Implement "Pay-As-You-Go" or micro-financing models in Somalia to address the high monthly energy expenditure of 18,000, making the upfront cost of clean energy more accessible.

**Market Expansion:** View the low 14% LPG usage as a prime market entry opportunity, specifically targeting the high-willingness segments in East Africa.

**3. Community and Development Organizations**

**Gender-Centric Outreach:** 
Leverage the 50% female demographic in Kenya to lead community education on the safety and efficiency of switching from Firewood to LPG or Electricity.

**Behavioral Change Advocacy:**
In South Africa, where willingness to switch is lowest (13%), launch awareness campaigns highlighting the long-term health benefits and cost savings of modern energy.

**Localized Solutions:**
Tailor community energy projects to the specific cost profiles of each country, recognizing that a solution for Kenya (1,000 avg. cost) may not fit the economic reality of Somalia (18,000 avg. cost).


**Technical Stack**

•	**Data Collection**: KoboToolbox

•	**Data Modeling**: Power BI

•	**Visualization**: Power BI with Map integration (Bing and TomTom)


**How to Use the Dashboard**
**1.	Filter by Fuel:** Use the "Main Cooking Fuel" slicer to see how different users, such as those using Charcoal or LPG, perceive costs.

**2.	Filter by Country:** Use the "Country" dropdown to isolate specific market dynamics in Nigeria or Somalia.

**3.	Gender Analysis:** Toggle gender filters to see how energy burden affects female-headed versus male-headed households differently.
